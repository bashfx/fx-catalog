## Phase I: Core System Bootstrap (Complete)

This phase establishes the foundational mechanics for installing and configuring the BashFX environment.

- âœ…Â **FEATURE-001: BASHFX Stage Setup (setup.dev)**
    
    - A fully unwindable setup utility to prime a developer's shell environment for installing BashFX.
        
    - Sub-tasks 1.1 - 1.5 are complete.
        
- âœ…Â **FEATURE-002: Environment Bootstrap (devfx)**
    
    - The core script's ability to install and configure the permanent BashFX environment.
        
    - Sub-tasks 2.1 - 2.4 are complete.
        
- âœ…Â **FEATURE-003: Safe Package Deployment**
    
    - The logic for deploying packages from the source repository and generating a package manifest. This is now handled by dedicated library modules.
        
    - Sub-tasks 3.1 - 3.4 are functionally complete and refactored intoÂ manifest.shÂ and helper functions.
        
- âœ…Â **FEATURE-004: Package Integrity & Linking**
    
    - The logic for verifying package integrity via checksums and creating symlinks for executables. This is now handled by dedicated library modules.
        
    - Sub-tasks 4.1 - 4.3 are functionally complete and refactored intoÂ integrity.shÂ andÂ pkglinker.sh.
        
- âœ…Â **FEATURE-005: Finalization & Stage Unwind**
    
    - The process by whichÂ devfxÂ self-promotes toÂ fxÂ and orchestrates the teardown of the temporary development environment.
        
    - Sub-tasks 5.1 - 5.3 are complete.

## Phase 1.5: Solidification & Foundational Testing (Current Focus)

This critical phase ensures the architectural refactoring from Phase I is stable and testable before new features are added.

- ğŸŸ¡Â **FEATURE-012: Test-Driven Development via Feature Drivers**
    
    - **Description:**Â Formalizes the testing strategy for the project. Each new feature must be accompanied by a test driver function.
        
    - **12.1: Driver Mechanism:**Â Implement aÂ devfx driver [N]Â subcommand to execute granular, feature-specific test functions namedÂ fx_f[N]_driver().
        
    - **12.2: Driver Responsibilities:**Â Each driver must test the "happy path" of its corresponding feature and be fully "Rewindable," cleaning up any artifacts it creates.
        
    - **12.3: Initial Driver Implementation:**Â CreateÂ fx_f3_driverÂ andÂ fx_f4_driverÂ to validate the now-complete package deployment and integrity logic.
        
- ğŸŸ¡Â **FEATURE-013: Architectural Refactoring & Integration**
    
    - **Description:**Â Complete the surgical refactoring ofÂ devfxÂ to use the new, modular libraries.
        
    - **13.1:Â devfxÂ Integration:**Â The mainÂ setupÂ function withinÂ devfxÂ must be updated to orchestrate calls toÂ manifest.sh,Â integrity.sh, andÂ pkglinker.sh, replacing its old monolithic logic.

## Phase II: User Experience & The Triumvirate (Planned)

This phase focuses on building out the user-facing tools and improving day-to-day usability.

- âšªÂ **FEATURE-007:Â pkgfxÂ - The Dedicated Package Manager**
    
    - **Description:**Â Formalize the creation of the standaloneÂ pkgfxÂ command, which will become the "Quartermaster" of the framework.
        
    - **7.1: Script Formalization:**Â Create theÂ pkgfx.shÂ source file. It will be a "Proper Script" with its own dispatcher.
        
    - **7.2: Logic Encapsulation:**Â TheÂ pkgfxÂ script will be built by sourcing theÂ manifest.sh,Â integrity.sh, andÂ pkglinker.shÂ libraries.
        
    - **7.3:Â fxÂ Command Delegation:**Â The mainÂ fxÂ command will be refactored to delegate all package-related tasks (install,Â uninstall, etc.) to theÂ pkgfxÂ executable.
        
- âšªÂ **FEATURE-006:Â fxÂ - User-Facing QOL Enhancements**
    
    - **Description:**Â A set of features to improve the usability and maintenance of the BashFX environment, implemented as subcommands in the mainÂ fxÂ tool.
        
    - **6.1: System Status (fx status):**Â A diagnostic tool that will callÂ pkgfx listÂ andÂ pkgfx verify.
        
    - **6.2: Self-Update (fx update):**Â A command toÂ git pullÂ the source and re-run the core deployment by callingÂ devfx setup.
        
    - **6.3: Tab Completion:**Â A completion script for bothÂ fxÂ andÂ pkgfxÂ commands.
        
    - **6.4: User-Facing Repair Warnings:**Â TheÂ fx.rcÂ startup warning whenÂ FX_REPAIR=trueÂ is set.
        
    - **6.5: Granular Help Text:**Â A "Comment Hack" based help system (fx help [command]).

## Phase III: Developer Experience & Automation (Planned)

This phase evolvesÂ fxÂ into a powerful developer assistant for creating new BashFX scripts.

- âšªÂ **FEATURE-008: Formalized Metadata Block**
    
    - **Description:**Â Standardize aÂ # key: valueÂ comment block in all "Proper Scripts" for metadata.
        
    - **8.1: Standard Keys:**Â Define keys forÂ name,Â desc,Â author,Â semver, andÂ alias.
        
    - **8.2: Parser Integration:**Â UpdateÂ pkgfxÂ to read theÂ # alias:Â key during installation.
        
- âšªÂ **FEATURE-009: Scaffolding Tool (fx dev create)**
    
    - **Description:**Â Implement a command to generate a new script from a "Proper Script" template.
        
- âšªÂ **FEATURE-010: Code Quality Tool (fx dev lint)**
    
    - **Description:**Â Implement a command to validate script metadata and optionally runÂ shellcheckÂ if it is installed.
        
- âšªÂ **FEATURE-011: Metadata Management Tool (fx dev meta)**
    
    - **Description:**Â Implement a command to programmatically get and set values in a script's metadata block.
